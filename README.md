# Active regulation of Ultraviolet (UV) light by wildlife
Collection of materials relevant to our ongoing research testing hypotheses about UV light regulation in reptiles. 

In brief, almost a century of ecological and evolutionary studies have established the importance of daily behaviors like basking and shuttling (movements between sun and shade) by lizards and other ectotherms for maintaining thermal homeostasis. That is, for regulating their internal body temperatures. In fact, those behaviors have become synonymous with temperature regulation--so much that they are putatively referred to as 'thermoregulatory behavior.' 


Put differently, an assumption underlying approaches thus far is that the only important function of those behaviors is temperature regulation. Aside from a few studies aimed at a zoo-based audience, consideration for the importance of other functions, has remained ignored. Our goal is to promote appreciation and further study of one function in particular: <b><i>regulation of UV light exposure. </b></i>




<b>Why UV?</b>

UV exposure stimulates endogenous production of vitamin D3 (Holick et al. 1995). Lizard skin contains the precursor for vitamin D3, and initiation of the conversion process requires sun exposure (Holick et al. 1995), and the amount of vitamin D3 produced depends on the extent of UV exposure (Karsten et al. 2009). The importance of maintaining appropriate circulating vitamin D3 levels extends to multiple fitness-relevant considerations, including bone development, organ function, embryogenesis and eggshell development, to name a few (Stumpf 1988; Laing and Fraser 1999; Ferguson et al. 1996). For example, in a pivotal study by Ferguson et al. (1996) on panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis), only females that were provided access to sufficient UV light sources produced eggs that developed to term and hatched successfully. Although reptiles can also obtain vitamin D3 via ingestion, efficacy of increasing the circulating concentration of vitamin D3 is greatest with solar UV exposure (Acierno et al. 2006); dietary D3 supplements alone are insufficient (Ferguson et al. 1996). At the same time, just as with temperature, prolonged exposure to extreme UV levels can be lethal (Ferguson et al. 1996). These considerations support that regulation of UV exposure within an optimal range should be adaptive. 

We capitalize on a classic framework (Hertz et al. 1993) for evaluating active temperature regulation in ectotherms ("cold-blooded" animals), Arduino-based electronic sensors and other components, and our lab's 3D printer, to study active UV regulation in those species.
